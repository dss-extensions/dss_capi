# Version 0.11

**not released**

- **Done**:
- The C headers for the two variantes (v7 and v8) have been unified into a single header. The old header files in `include/v7/dss_capi.h` and include/v8/dss_capi.h` have been modified to use this new header (`include/dss_capi.h`). Functions specific to v8 are ifdef'ed and also marked with a `/*V8*/` comment to make it easier to filter in automated tools.
- The GR API for string arrays was dropped since it didn't bring benefits (GR arrays of bytes, ints and floats will continue).
- Replace `uint16_t` with `int8_t` in C headers, `WordBool` with `Boolean` in Pascal. This was an artifact from the COM code. The new type, besides being the natural type in Pascal, should match the `bool` type in most modern C/C++ compilers. This may still be replaced with int32_t to reduce the types used before v0.11 is released.


- **Planned**:
    - extend the API to work with 64-bit integers where appropriate
    - complement the API with the missing classes
    - initial work on the plotting and extended reporting API
    - potentially unify the v7 and v8 codebases into a single library. Since v8 is unstable and hard to debug, it might be dropped due to lack of time.
    
# Version 0.10.4

- Updated up to revision 2761 of the official OpenDSS code. The changes affect at least the following components: CIMXML export, `Capacitor`, `InvControl`, `LineGeometry`, `PVsystem`, `StorageController`, `Storage`, `Vsource`, `VCCS`.
- This version should be fully compatible with 0.10.3.
- Fixes issue with long paths on Linux, potentially other platforms too.

# Version 0.10.3

- Updated up to revision 2609 of the official OpenDSS code. Most of the new features have been ported and tested successfully.
- The KLUSolve code has been moved to a new repository at https://github.com/dss-extensions/klusolve/ -- to avoid confunsion with the upstream project (which hasn't seen any development for a couple of years), we refer to it by "DSS-Extensions KLUSolve". 
- The repository `electricdss-src` was merged into `dss_capi`. That is, the main repository for DSS C-API now contains most of the relevant OpenDSS code side-by-side with the API code. This simplified management and also makes it easier to build the library.
- The default packages use GCC-based DLLs for Windows. If you encounter issues with your application, our [KLUSolve](https://github.com/dss-extensions/klusolve/releases) also distributes MSVC2017 DLLs.
- On Windows, besides the original MSVC import libraries, the default packages now also include GCC import libraries.
- Fixes issue with the line parameters on Linux and macOS due to memory-address aliasing issues.
- Correctly enables DSS_CAPI_EARLY_ABORT by default.
- Extra validation has been added for many functions. This should avoid some crashes due to uninitialized states or user errors. The Error API is used extensively for this -- remember to check for errors periodically!
- v8: Several fixes, working on both macOS and Linux, including validation. On Windows there might be threading issues. Please open an issue if you'd like to use it on Windows (there are a couple of workarounds).
- Optimized (small, dense) matrix-vector multiplication, up to 20% time-savings
- The APIs for most classes now include `*_Get_idx` and `*_Set_idx` functions. 
- The `*_Set_Name` functions are now faster by default, as well as present linear behavior with the system size.
- `XYCurves`: Add `XYCurves_Get_AllNames`
- Ported to v7: the DSS commands `CalcIncMatrix`, `CalcIncMatrix_O`, `Refine_BusLevels`, `CalcLaplacian`, and related export options: `IncMatrix`, `IncMatrixRows`, `IncMatrixCols`, `BusLevels`, `Laplacian`, `ZLL`, `ZCC`, `Contours`, `Y4`

- General optimization of copies in the API-level code, avoiding extra copies or loops where possible
- `Transformers`: new `Transformers_Get_LossesByType` and `Transformers_Get_AllLossesByType` to get total losses, load losses and no-load losses for the transformers.
- New `Settings_Get_LoadsTerminalCheck` and `Settings_Set_LoadsTerminalCheck`: can be used for static scenarios (no open terminals for loads) to toggle the costly checks for open terminals. If set to false, it can save around 25% of simulation time, depending on the circuit characteristics.
- New `CktElement_Get_IsIsolated` (fetches the current value for a single element, see the Topology API for more info).
- New `Lines_Get_IsSwitch`/`Lines_Set_IsSwitch`, equivalent to the `switch=y/n` via DSS command.
- `PVSystems`: expose some requested properties (daily, duty, yearly, Tdaily, Tduty, Tyearly). Still missing some more properties.
- New `DSS_GR_DataPtr_P*` and `DSS_GR_CountPtr_P*`: alternative Global Result API functions, needed for [DSS_MATLAB](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_matlab).
- `DSS_Set_AllowForms`: on Windows, only allow enabling the console output if there is a console available.

Some highlights from the upstream OpenDSS changes:
- `ReduceCkt`: new interface with circuit reduction methods
- `Lines`: new seasonal ratings mechanism that allows changing the current rating through the simulation
- `ExpControl`: new `PreferQ` option

# Version 0.10.2

- `CtrlQueue`: Add the missing function `CtrlQueue_Push`.
- New `DSS_Get_AllowEditor` and `DSS_Set_AllowEditor`:  AllowEditor controls whether the external editor is used in commands like `Show`. If you set to 0 (false), the editor is not executed. Note that other side effects, such as the creation of files, are not affected.
- `LoadShapes` code reworked: more validation, fix potential memory issues after resizing using `Npts`, and faster reads and writes (up to 3x).
- The ouput libraries/DLLs have been moved from `lib/v7` and `lib/v8` to just `lib` since the libraries already have different names. The previous organization was due to expectations that we would keep only the OpenDSS Version 8 line of code but at the moment the main development is focused of DSS C-API on Version 7.

# Version 0.10.1

*Besides `CktElement_Get_Variable` and `CktElement_Get_Variablei`, version 0.10.1 should be API and ABI compatible with 0.10.0.*

## DSS C-API and custom OpenDSS changes

- Several more functions now use the Error interface to provide error information. If you use DSS C-API, you should check `Error_Get_Number`, at least from time to time
- New `Error_Get_NumberPtr`: returns a pointer to the current error. Whenever the pointer content is non-zero, check `Error_Get_Description` and then reset it zero
- New `Error_Get_EarlyAbort` and `Error_Set_EarlyAbort`: Gets/sets the DSS script error-handling behavior. If a warning or error occurs and early abortion is enabled (default), the processing of the script is always halted. Otherwise, the processing of the script continues until a major error occurs or it finishes.
- New `DSS_Get_PAnsiChar`: for use in [DSS MATLAB](https://github.com/PMeira/dss_matlab) to avoid triple-pointer indirections (MATLAB doesn't like those).
- New `GICSources` family of functions: ported from COM
- `BatchEdit` DSS command is now case-insensitive in FPC for consistency with COM
- Line breaks now respect the platform defaults (instead of CR+LF on all platforms).
- Implement `Monitors_Get_FileVersion`, which was incomplete in COM (should return 1 as the current version)
- Rename to `LoadShapes_Get_SInterval`/`LoadShapes_Set_SInterval` for case consistency. Aliases are provided for the previous names, but those were deprecated and will be removed in the future.
- `DSSProperty_Set_Val`: error out if the current property index is invalid
- `Circuit_SetCktElementIndex` and `Circuit_SetCktElementName`: error out if invalid inputs are provided
- `CktElement_Get_Variable` and `CktElement_Get_Variablei`: fix bug -- the second parameter, `Code`, is a pointer to integer, not a simple integer. `Code` is an out parameter that contains an error code.
- `Loads_Set_ZIPV`: check if exactly 7 values are provided, otherwise errors out
- `Meters` family: 
    - error out if current `ActiveSection` is invalid
    - check if meter zone lists are built more thorougly (avoids invalid memory accesses), errors out if invalid (also patched in `electricdss-src`)
    - avoid out-of-bounds memory access when using `Meters_DoReliabilityCalc` (patched in `electricdss-src`)
- Linux build changes for KLUSolve: changes target distributing the shared object for projects like DSS MATLAB:
    - The version script exposes only KLUSolve symbols, hiding all KLU related symbols that might get in conflict with external libraries that use other versions of KLU.
    - A rpath change makes it simple to load KLUSolve from the same folder as DSS C-API, without moving anything or changing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- Ported from V8 to V7:
    - StorageController: new `PeakShaveLow` charge mode
    - PVsystem: new `WattPriority` property
    - Sensor: "Bug found in sensor.pas when defining powers instead of currents for load allocation" (commit by davismont)
- Update building scripts
- Binary releases for Windows, Linux and macOS are now provided
- Reformat source code with JEDI Code Format
