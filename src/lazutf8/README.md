# Notes from DSS C-API

This is a filtered copy of LazUtils from Lazarus components, specifically 
to provide LazUTF8.
Please see the source files for details about licensing.

You can get a full copy of the Lazarus source code on SourceForge at 
https://sourceforge.net/p/lazarus/laz.git/ci/main/tree/

The specific version used here is from the `lazarus_2_2_0` tag, you can 
grab it with the following git command, on subfolder `components/lazutils`:

    git clone --depth 1 --branch lazarus_2_2_0 https://git.code.sf.net/p/lazarus/laz.git lazarus

Since the SourceForge Git can be slow, the repository is heavy, and Lazarus 
itself is too big to justify installing just for LazUTF8, we decided to 
distribute a copy here.
